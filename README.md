# Solar-Cell-Surface-Degradation-Monitor-System
This peoject aims to creat measuring system using customized 4-probes station integrated with TLM method to closely measure the contact resistivity of solar cells in order to monitor the surface degradtion.

System is designed and created by Neil Wang (yxw1300@case.edu), Paul McCabe, Kehley Coleman from ECSE398 Senior Project at Case Western Reserve University. 

First, the whole system consists of Arduino Due, Keithley2400, two mechanical relays, 25-pin PCB board with spring-loaded probes. The detailed description and controling program are attached in the files below.
